A helpful app that makes your bill splitting with your friends much easier. </br>
Checkpoints while developing this app: </br>
-Evolving my props and states management </br>
-More children prop as any JSX Markup </br>
-Creating reusable components such as Friend Componens & Button component with different CSS styling properties such as BackgroundColor, text Color or Children </br>
-Handle UI Components display based on state(hidden/not) </br>
-Creating Controlled Elements such as Form Text Input or Select </br>
-Handling onSubmit Form event, onClick and onChange events. </br>
