A helpful app that makes your bill splitting with your friends much easier.
Checkpoints while developing this app:
-Evolving my props and states management
-More children prop as any JSX Markup
-Creating reusable components such as Friend Componens & Button component with different CSS styling properties such as BackgroundColor, text Color or Children
-Handle UI Components display based on state(hidden/not)
-Creating Controlled Elements such as Form Text Input or Select;
-Handling onSubmit Form event, onClick and onChange events.
